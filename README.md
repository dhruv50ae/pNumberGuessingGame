# Python Number Guessing Game

- This objective for this application was to try create a problem that can be solved using algorithms. Named the application a 'game' to make it sound more appealing rather than 'Number guessing algorithm'.

## Description

- Uses random to pick numbers
- The user needs to employ the best algorithm to find the number
- You can choose difficulty
- Uses a while loop for the majority of the code ran
- Functions tackles repetitive code that is executed

## What I learnt

- Function efficiency âœ…
- Debugging using StackOverflow and Google âœ…
- Different algorithms âœ…
- Random method usages âœ…
- Conditional statements âœ…
## How To Use

- Select a game difficulty by tying easy or hard when first ran.
- You will get a hidden number, employ the best finding algorithm to discover the number.
- Make sure you don't run out of lives! (The best algorithm loses less lives, or you are lucky ðŸ‘€)
- There is no catch for errors, so the application might break if there are any misinputs
